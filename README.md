# Sortomatic
Very poorly made, but felt like sharing, Python Script to sort .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .bmp Into a list of images in size order.

If i ever update this, i will upload changes. I doubt anyone would need this, but felt like sharing either way as i needed it and was lazy and didn't want to look for one.
